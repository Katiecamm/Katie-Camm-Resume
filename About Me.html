        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I’m Katie Camm! I grew up in a blue-collar town with headstrong people and beautiful sights. Although no one knew what graphic design was in my hometown, in hindsight it's obvious that I was a designer from the get-go. On every project I could, I would make it “a work of art” as my mom called it. I loved making information visually stunning, and that passion has stayed with me after all these years. </p>

        <h2>My Process</h2>
        <p>My process is varied. While I have methods that are my go-to for exploring solutions to design problems, when those are not helping me ideate, I switch gears and explore alternatives. When possible, I prefer to do research in person. Taking notes in the moment about the lived experience helps connect me to the real design challenge and allows for a lens into potential solutions.</p>

        <h2>Pandemic Fish Fin Clipping?</h2>
        <p>During the pandemic, I lost my job. The day after that I got a new job. In the blink of an eye, I became a fish fin clipper.
            In order for fishermen to tell the difference between state raised salmon and wild salmon, a fin no larger that a grain of rice has to be clipped from the back end of a baby salmon. So, from March through June of 2020, I clipped over 4,500 salmon every day. I even moved up the ranks from basic clipper to supervisor and then back down to clipper with the ability to act as a supervisor whenever the big guy needed a smoke break.</p>
